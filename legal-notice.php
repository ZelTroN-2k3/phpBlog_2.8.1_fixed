                <p>
                    The main goal of freelance-addons.net is to disseminate information on electronics to the general public. 
                    The themes addressed relate to what the author is passionate about, without aiming to be complete or exhaustive. 
                    Here, the author seeks to share as much knowledge, experience, and discoveries as possible about electronics and everything surrounding it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, as the author is neither an engineer, nor a teacher, nor an expert in electronics, inaccuracies may appear. 
                    We encourage all readers to exchange with the author at the bottom of each article, noting any errors or inaccuracies, in order to perpetually improve the content of this site.
